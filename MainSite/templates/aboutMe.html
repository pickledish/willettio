	<p><h2> Who am I, anyway </h2></p><br/>

	<p>Well, take a look around – certainly not a web developer! My main area of work leans a bit more backend, specializing in the study of algorithms and their complexity, and (more recently) their application to the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. My favorite kinds of problems to solve aren't the ones where we synthesize <em>lots</em> of data, but the ones where we synthesize <em>new</em> data – problems where a good, well thought-out program can crack open an issue which could really use the help. Have a look at <a href="https://github.com/pickledish/TrafficLights">traffic lights</a>, for example – it uses a (definitely oversimplified) simulation of the cars and intersections of city streets to find the optimal set of timings for traffic indicators. A place where a little bit Markov chain magic can go a long way towards reducing commuting misery!</p><br/>

	<p>As for what I'm up to, I'm currently a student at the University of Rochester, in the beautiful state of New York. I'm due to graduate in May of 2018 with a B.S. in Computer Science, a B.A. in Math, and a mediocre grasp of the French language. In school, I've been spending my time learning as much about algorithmic complexity as I can, since my dream is to one day create a program clever enough to fundamentally change the way people travel. With the rest of my time, I do research in computational statistics for the Chemical Engineering department here at the U of R, and I'm lucky enough to be a TA for some of my favorite CS classes (like Language Design and Implementation).</p><br/>

	<p>In my free time, I currently like to waste hours next to a stove trying to make a cup of coffee that actually lives up to my apparently-ridiculous standards, keep my 1990's Cannondale in good working order, read, and sit next to large bodies of water.</p>
