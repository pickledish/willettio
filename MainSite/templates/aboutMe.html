	<h2> Who is me? </h2>

	I'm currently a student at the University of Rochester, in the beautiful state of New York. I'm due to graduate in December of 2017, with a major in Computer Science, a minor in Math, and (Parisians willing, when I make it over there next year) a fluent grasp of the French language. In school, I've been studying data science and the application of linear algebra, and on the side I've been working at picking up some more front-end experience, like with JQuery and the more popular web frameworks. In fact, this very website was born in the process! <br> <br>

	I've worked part-time in IT for the last six years, and been a TA for some Computer Science classes at my school (introductory and data structures, which I love) for one. More recently, I've become a supervisor at Event and Classroom Management here at the U of R, and taken up work developing web software to analyze and visualize the effect of small changes on an algorithm that solves linear systems. This last job, while new, is definitely my favorite so far since it gives me the chance to put some real care into the code I'm writing, and have that actually matter. <br> <br>

	In my free time, I currently like to waste hours next to a stove trying to make a cup of coffee that actually lives up to my apparently-ridiculous standards, learn how to do a better job fixing up my 1990's bicycle, read, and sit outside watching squirrels do whatever it is that squirrels like to do. I've given up on trying to figure out what that is, though.
